# TS Express Prisma


## Git Commit Message
It is forced to commit [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to this repository. For commiting in this style you can use this [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) or use this [CLI Tool](https://github.com/pshaddel/homebrew-conventionalcommit) that I implemented.
### How to Disable it? 

Got to `.husky/commit-msg` and comment the line that checks commit message. You can also remove these two packagees if you do not want to have a standard on commit messages: `"@commitlint/cli": "^17.4.4"`, `"@commitlint/config-conventional": "^17.4.4"`
